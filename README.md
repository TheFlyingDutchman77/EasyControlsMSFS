# EasyControls for MSFS
EasyControls application for Microsoft Flight Simulator

First beta version downloadable here (this might still have some bugs, but works fine for me so far): https://github.com/TheFlyingDutchman77/EasyControlsMSFS/blob/main/EasyControls_v0.1.zip

Upon first usage, you might be prompted to install a Dotnet core library from Microsoft.



**Feature list (to be developed)**
- Create a walkthrough and proper manual
- Add posibility to use a key to get a different set of bindings (e.g. with CTRL)
- Add ability to enter more than 3 axis via the menu (instead of editing the control.xml file)  -- INCLUDED in v0.1
- Automatically load correct aircraft by checking sim aircraft -- INCLUDED in v0.1
