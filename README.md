# EasyControls for MSFS
EasyControls application for Microsoft Flight Simulator

First beta version downloadable here (this might still have some bugs, but works fine for me so far): https://github.com/TheFlyingDutchman77/EasyControlsMSFS/blob/main/EasyControlsforMSFS.zip


**Feature list (to be developed)**
- Automatically load correct aircraft by checking sim aircraft
- Add posibility to use a key to get a different set of bindings (e.g. with CTRL)
- Add ability to enter more than 3 axis via the menu (instead of editing the control.xml file)
